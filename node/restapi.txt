restapi is important :---

1.Represenational state transfer--

2.The response should be the same irrespective of making request 

3.route name should be same 

4.data should be in JSON format 
  for transfer
5.process should be stateless (one request response cycle should be independent );




status code :----

//get(from server2.js)[below condition is valid only when the route pathis same ]
--> if there is more than one get function in the node server then the only that app.get will run which comes the first and rest will not be executed 



#######################################

1..as code execution-->As soon as res.end line is exeuted there is no further execution of lower handler function even if they satisfies all the condition.

2..Res: when a request is send then it will execute all the route handlers serially

3..Next :--sends request to the handler below it 

***if*** request hits your handler 
         use->it will always execute the funnction 
         get->route  + get method then it will execute the function
         post->route + post method then it will execute the function
         patch->route + patch method then it will execute the function
         delete->route + delete method then it will execute the function
