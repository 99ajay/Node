restapi is important :---

1.Represenational state transfer--

2.The response should be the same irrespective of making request 

3.route name should be same 

4.data should be in JSON format 
  for transfer
5.process should be stateless (one request response cycle should be independent );




status code :----

//get(from server2.js)[below condition is valid only when the route pathis same ]
--> if there is more than one get function in the node server then the only that app.get will run which comes the first and rest will not be executed
